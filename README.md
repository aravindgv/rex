Devops With Rex

I have recently been playing with Rex and wanted to write down some of my initial thoughts.

Rex is a devops tool that helps you manage your servers. Its similar to Puppet Lab’s mcollective tool or ansible. You can easily run commands on your entire fleet of boxen or just on certain subgroups. And you can run them in parallel which saves you giant baskets of time.

The big advantage for People Who Prefer Perl (PWPP) is that Rex is written and configured with Perl. So for the most part you don’t need to spend a lot of time learning yet another DSL.
